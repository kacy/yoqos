# changelog

## 0.1.0

the first release. `os` runs an arch machine from one config file, and on a
btrfs root with grub it keeps whole-system generations you can boot back
into.

on any arch install:

- `os init` reads the machine into `machine.toml`, `imported.toml`, and
  `machine.lock`, and changes nothing else.
- `os plan` and `os apply` manage packages (through libalpm, at the exact
  versions in the lock), `[system]` settings, services (over sd-bus),
  users and groups, files, sysctl, kernel modules, cpu microcode, and gpu
  drivers.
- `os update` resolves against today's arch packages, shows the arch news
  since the last update and a short summary of what moves, and writes the
  new lock only once the machine has it.
- `os add`, `remove`, `enable`, `disable`, and `adopt` edit the config in
  place, keeping its comments and formatting, and relock it.
- `os status`, `os why`, and `os history` explain the machine; a pacman
  hook records changes made with `pacman` directly.
- `os rollback` goes back to an earlier config and lock from the package
  cache.
- `[desktop]` covers hyprland, pipewire, and the login: greetd, sddm, or a
  tty. an omarchy profile ships in `/usr/share/yoq/profiles`.

on a btrfs root with grub, `os enable-rollback` adds generations:

- every change is a generation in the boot menu, and `/var`, `/home`,
  `/root`, `/srv`, and `/usr/local` stay out of them.
- `os rollback [n]` starts an older generation as a new one, with its
  config, and passwords, host keys, and the machine id carry over.
- a change that needs a reboot boots once on trial. a failed health check,
  a hung boot, or a kernel that can't boot falls back to the generation
  before by itself.
- `os gc` and `os pin` manage how many generations stay.
- it works on arch's cloud image layout and on archinstall's, including an
  esp at `/boot`.

everything takes `--json`, errors have stable codes (`os explain`), and the
limits are listed in `docs/generations.md`.
